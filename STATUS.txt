  1.0.0      - In Development


Release Showstoppers
--------------------

Version 1.0: Pilot

* Localize the website - Michelle can handle
    - Create a simple way for our website to be localized for
      any future language.

* Add translations for Cantonese - Michelle can handle

* Add translations for Spanish - Michelle

* Design a leaflet / flyer "wallet-sized"
    - multi-lingual (English, Cantonese, Spanish to start)
    - target audience is people applying for or receiving
      SNAP benefits.

* Create a press kit
    - icon in EPS
    - mission statement blurb or other approved blurbs
    - leaflet / flyer in EPS form (perhaps in 10-up layout)

* Create an About Us page
    - who we are
    - why we're doing this
    - our story
    - (Make it easy for new contributors to add themselves to this list,
      as an incentive for new contributions)

* Add link to our discuss@snapfresh.org mailing list to snapfresh.org

* Improve the color scheme of the website

* Improve the instructions for inputting an address.
    - suggest that adding a zip code may improve results
    - make sure our examples work properly

* Add a privacy statement

* Add a disclaimer (this may be part of the privacy statement, IANAL)


Version 1.1:

* Add geolocation support to the web app.
    - HTML5/JS has support for browser-based geolocation
    - this will work great on mobile phones, but also works on
      regular browsers.
    - it could be automatic or could be triggered on user action

* Set up a wiki (mediawiki). [aaron]

Unconfirmed Bugs

Ideas
-----

* Incorporate EBT Cash benefits data into our application.
    - There are some interesting business logic details here. For example,
      some ATMs are part of a network where unlimited withdrawls are allowed.
      Others only allow a limited number of withdrawls per month. All should
      be geolocated (coords, address). Angela has some sample data for us.


* Benefits Re-application reminder
    - benefits must be renewed every 3 months. If the renewal date passes,
      the process to re-apply is much more cumbersome for both the applicant
      and for the government agency. We might consider adding a feature where
      people can sign up for reminder SMS/push notification/email/etc...


Wish List / Optimizations
-------------------------

* Search for SNAP Retailers by date/time
    - this will be particularly beneficial for people who wish to use their
      benefits on the day when they are received in bulk each month. This is
      because SNAP and EBT Cash benefits are distributed all at once each
      month.
