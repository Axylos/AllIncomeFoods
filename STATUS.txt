* Print the Wallet-cards. [vakil]

* Press-sized EPS needs Chinese proof. [suzanne]

* Create an About Us page [michelle]

      as an incentive for new contributions)
    - Add link to our discuss@snapfresh.org mailing list to snapfresh.org [michelle]

* Add a privacy statement
    - find sample copy from SF [vakil]
    - "we value your privcy" link to privacy page
    - we will track usage
    - we won't sell it
    - do we want to adhere to the government's own standards for privacy?
    - are there other sites doing something similar to us that we could
      steal from?

* Add a disclaimer (this may be part of the privacy statement, IANAL)
    - find sample copy from SF [vakil]
    - independent project, not official part of government agency
    - do we want to adhere to the government's own standards for this?
    - are there other sites doing something similar to us that we could
      steal from?

* Install log-analytics programs onto dolores. [aaron]

* Research including farmers markets into pilot. [jeremy]


Version 1.1:

* Research including restaurants that accept SNAP cards? [?]
    - some SF restaurants support this
        - elderly, homeless, disabled
    - now other counties are supporting
    - prep some sample data [vakil]
    - CA may have a DB for this already [michelle]

* Prepare sample food-bank data. [vakil]

* Add geolocation support to the web app.
    - HTML5/JS has support for browser-based geolocation
    - this will work great on mobile phones, but also works on
      regular browsers.
    - it could be automatic or could be triggered on user action

    - Logos
    - Allows us to track a separate URL in our analytics.

* Press release after a month of feedback? [arthur?]

* Can we incorporate food bank data beyond SF?
    - Vakil has SF food bank data, but we know of no nation-wide DB.


Known Bugs
----------

Unconfirmed Bugs
----------------

Ideas
-----

* Incorporate EBT Cash benefits data into our application.
    - There are some interesting business logic details here. For example,
      some ATMs are part of a network where unlimited withdrawls are allowed.
      Others only allow a limited number of withdrawls per month. All should
      be geolocated (coords, address). Angela has some sample data for us.


* Benefits Re-application reminder
    - benefits must be renewed every 3 months. If the renewal date passes,
      the process to re-apply is much more cumbersome for both the applicant
      and for the government agency. We might consider adding a feature where
      people can sign up for reminder SMS/push notification/email/etc...


Wish List / Optimizations
-------------------------

* Search for SNAP Retailers by date/time
    - this will be particularly beneficial for people who wish to use their
      benefits on the day when they are received in bulk each month. This is
      because SNAP and EBT Cash benefits are distributed all at once each
      month.

Done
----

Release 1.0.0:

* Acquire a 415 number for the pilot. [jeremy]

* Improve the color scheme of the website. [jeremy]

* Localize the website - [michelle]
    - Our website is localized using the builtin Rails i18n method.
      For each language that needs translation, just need the actual
      translations placed into a custom .yml file in the config/locales
      folder. The i18n is configured to default to whatever language
      a user has set their browser to. If nothing is set, then it
      defaults to English, and a user can easily switch between
      languages by clicking on the appropriate language link at the
      bottom of each page.
    - As of 9/27/2011, we have support for the following lanugages:
      English
      Spanish
      Chinese Traditional (Cantonese)

* Logo has been designed. [?]

* Wallet-card is designed. [?]
    - What languages?

* Press-sized EPS is designed (still needs to be finished up).

* Improve the instructions for inputting an address. [jeremy, ysiad]
    - suggest that adding a zip code may improve results
    - make sure our examples work properly


TBD, please add in other items as you complete them, if they are user visible.
This will be used to keep track of high-level changes for whenever we want to
produce a release announcement.
